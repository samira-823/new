    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <div class="xy">
      <img src="images\dormammus.webp" alt="dormammu">
      <p>Clea was born to Prince Orini (son of Olnar, the former ruler of the Dark Dimension) and the Faltine fugitive Umar (sister of the Dreadful Dormammu). Clea's birth was very traumatic to Umar and the experience scarred her even more when she
        learned she had lost the ability to revert to her Faltinian form. She abandoned Clea with Orini and became violent, picking a conflict with her brother. In her weakened state, however, she was defeated by Dormammu and banished to another
        realm.Clea grew up unaware of who her mother was and worshipping Dormammu, who her father served loyally.</p>

        Conquering Planet Earth was part of Dormammu's plans, and, during one of his attempts, Doctor Strange was asked by the Ancient One to travel to the Dark Dimension and try to stop him. Once there, he was seen by a curious Clea, who decided to
        follow the "human creature". Impressed by him, she sought to save his life by trying to dissuade him from facing Dormammu, but was unsuccessful, as Strange was ready to give his own life to stop him. Soon, Dormammu imprisoned Clea for her
        betrayal, planning to punish her after battling Strange. However, during the duel between Strange and Dormammu, the Mindless Ones, that were being kept in check by Dormammu, escaped, forcing Strange and Dormammu to work together to contain
        the creatures. Now in Strange's debt, Dormammu was forced to comply
        with his desires to release Clea and not invade Planet Earth.

        Clea and Strange met again rather soon, and Strange confessed he was done trying to move past love and wanted to embrace it. Since they couldn't be legally married (due to Clea's status as an extradimensional being), Strange and Clea began
        wearing magic rings that were actually only one and were therefore mystically connected for all eternity.
